This repository contains the code created during the workshop "Augmented Reality concepts using HoloLens in Mathematics Communication"  during the Imaginary Conference (IC16 - ic16.imaginary.org) in Berlin, Germany, between the 20th and 22nd of July, 2016.

The objective of the workshop was to study the feasibility of building applications for Mathematics Communication using Augmented Reality, in particular the HoloLens (http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens). The code implemented simulates the action of different forces over a set of particles. The main idea is to provide a core set of features that can be extended to simulate different types of forces, and to be able to manipulate directly elements of the simulation and see the results in real time.

The code was created in Unity using the Personal and Personal + Holo Lens editions.

The workshop was lead by Alexander Werlberger from Holo Light (www.holo-light.com) and Sebastian Uribe from Imaginary (www.imaginary.org) and had the guidance of CÃ¨dric Villani (http://cedricvillani.org). 
The workshop participants were: Vitalii Komliev, Tomas Laurenzo, Dong Gyu Lim, Sebastian Mansow-Model, Oleksandr Motsak, Karen Otte, Eddy Richard, Henry Segerman and Alain Xerri.
